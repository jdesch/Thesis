  abstract = {The term working memory refers to a brain system that provides temporary
	storage and manipulation of the information necessary for such complex
	cognitive tasks as language comprehension, learning, and reasoning.
	This definition has evolved from the concept of a unitary short-term
	memory system. Working memory has been found to require the simultaneous
	storage and processing of information. It can be divided into the
	following three subcomponents: (i) the central executive, which is
	assumed to be an attentional-controlling system, is important in
	skills such as chess playing and is particularly susceptible to the
	effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two slave systems, namely (ii)
	the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates visual images and
	(iii) the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based
	information and is necessary for the acquisition of both native and
	second-language vocabulary.},

	involving temporary storage must be extended to include working memory
	based on storage in long-term memory. In the proposed theoretical
	framework cognitive processes are viewed as a sequence of stable
	states representing end products of processing. In skilled activities,
	acquired memory skills allow these end products to be stored in long-term
	memory and kept directly accessible by means of retrieval cues in
	short-term memory, as proposed by skilled memory theory. These theoretical
	claims are supported by a review of evidence on memory in text comprehension

	(such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are
	combined when classifying novel instances. Previous research has
	shown that an ensemble is often more accurate than any of the single
	classifiers in the ensemble. Bagging (Breiman, 1996c) and Boosting
	(Freund \&amp; Schapire, 1996; Schapire, 1990) are two relatively
	new but popular methods for producing ensembles. In this paper we
	evaluate these methods on 23 data sets using both neural networks
	and decision trees as our classification algorithm. Our results clearly
	indicate a number of conclusions. First, while Bagging is almost
	always more accurate than a single classifier, it is sometimes much
	less accurate than Boosting. On the other hand, Boosting can create
	ensembles that are less accurate than a single classifier -- especially
	when using neural networks. Analysis indicates that the performance
	of the Boosting methods is dependent on the charac...},
